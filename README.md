# Programming Puzzles

This repo has different programming puzzles that you can find on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/) or other similar websites.

This repo is part of a learning experience for sharing and keep growing, but most important, to get fun by solving puzzles.

## Structure

The [problems](problems) folder has 3 categories ([Easy](easy), [medium](medium) and [hard](hard)) with several numbered folders that contains a puzzle. The numbering is just for ordering the puzzles by adding time, so you can start from any number without any problem.

## How to run tests

Since the repo is written in [Deno](https://deno.land/#installation), you must have it installed to run the next command in the CLI:

```
deno test --importmap=./import_map.json --unstable
```

## Have fun

This project will be part of a new idea for _[Codeando Pues](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaRp1KzFEEpBbBpr8mMm0jg)_ as the intention is to explain how to get the answer of these problems and use Github Issues as a feedback provider.
